PHP? Perl? Apache? Time to do development with archeological twist.

## The Stack
The tools we are expected to use are

- XAMPP
- React


## XAMPP
"_XAMPP is an easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. Just download and start the installer. It's that easy._"

For this course, XAMPP package is intended for Windows users to easily run PHP 8 with a straightforward relatioal database setup. To translate this requirement for linux use, I use a premade XAMPP container environment [tomsik68/xampp](https://hub.docker.com/r/tomsik68/xampp) with compose.
